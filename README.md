When you touch the + button, you add +1 to the stock and when you push the - button you decrease the stock by 1. (When the stock is 0 and the button is pressed, an alert will pop up, saying "Invalid Number").
When the button "Agregar Producto" is pressed, the footer displays the product you just added to the cart, you can do this multiple times.
